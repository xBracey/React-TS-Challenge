# Take-home challenge instructions

## Spinning up the dev environment

Before spinning up the dev environment, there are a few things that need to done:

- Install NPM dependencies by running `npm i`
- Create an env file by copying the example environment file `cp .env.example .env`
- In the env file, populate the field `APP_MOVIEDB_API_KEY` with a valid API key from MovieDB

Once these instructions are done, spin up a dev environment by running `npm start`
